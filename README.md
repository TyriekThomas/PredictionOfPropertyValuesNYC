# PredictionOfNYCPropertyValues
At the start of each year, the NYC Department of Finance contacts property owners to update them on their properties’ new “Revised Market Value” based on the previous information that they received from the previous year.  In this project I will train a Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict property values based on the provided attributes.
